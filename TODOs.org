** Performance

*** TODO Look into using Celluloid and/or jruby to improve performance
          Thinking about concurrency for performance improvements

          read base
          read local
          read remote

          base + local -> diff l
          base + remote -> diff b

          diff l + diff b -> conflict detection

          cd -> each conflict type

          conflicts -> conflict resolution

          cr (user response)

          serialize result (single)


** Diff/Merge

*** Conflicts can happen on the same diff 2x. How to handle this?
*** DONE In `Change.to_s` - deref args that point to other elements (like archimate_element)
    CLOSED: [2017-02-01 Wed 12:48]
*** In Diagram children diffs - make to_s reference the parent diagram
*** DONE Array diffs on non-id'd diffable elements should detect changes rather than delete/insert
    CLOSED: [2017-02-01 Wed 12:48]
*** Archi file could have ids that conflict (i.e. 2 relationships with same id - this is bad!!! Was it a bad merge or something worse)
*** Implement check for de-duplicated merges
*** DONE Add a summary diff - elements added/changed/deleted, diagrams
    CLOSED: [2017-02-01 Wed 12:48]

*** DONE See what can be done about performance
    CLOSED: [2017-02-01 Wed 12:46]
     - Reading file 11-12 secs
     - deleted relationships referenced in diagrams is slow

    CLOSED: [2017-02-01 Wed 12:46]
*** DONE Refactor merge to pull apply diffs out
    CLOSED: [2017-02-01 Wed 12:46]

*** TODO Refactor DataModel classes to use enumeration classes for appropriate values
*** TODO Add a test to produce SVG output for the "everything.archimate" file
*** TODO Add a test to produce a badges diagram


* Refactor of data model for diff/merge purposes

** Validation
*** Identifiable objects exist one place in model
*** 
** Join:
   - Organizable Id (An Organizable is an Identifiable that can be contained in a Folder
   - Folder
   - Position in Folder - index isn't good here ... should that position really be a linked list?
* Introduce the idea of archimate modules
  - Allow creation of a focused model by including archimate modules - which are self-contained packages of elements and relationships
  - Allow inheritance of a module to permit showing changes to an existing model.
** How to implement?
   - Break things down automatically?
   - By Layer?
   - How to Deal with relationships across module boundaries?
* Need to have model merge capability
* TODO Refactor to use a Decorator approach using SimpleDelegator
* TODO Remove Dry-Types dependency
* TODO Scan git history and inject metadata for concepts created by git author
* Changes for v3 have borked the model
** TODO Push through fixes focusing on the issues from factories to see if that works
** TODO Refactor model to eliminate a lot of cruft by removing things like in_model= and populating model with objects instead of ID refs
** TODO Refactor model to improve the diffing of arrays and by writing explicit diff decorators rather than domain model magic
   Both of the last two options risk breaking diffing/merging by making and becoming a long slog

* TODO In mergetool - show diagrams that reference elements and relationships in diff conflicts

* More Notes

background_class -> used by entity_shape
badge -> entity_badge -> to_svg
entity_shape


text_bounds (I think this is only set in entity_shape)
DiagramModelReference assigns the entity from the child.model_element
badge_bounds in Gap, MotivationEntity, RectEntity, RoundedRectEntity
text_align in Note

some shapes are dependent on child.child_type

badge should be controlled by the entity_shape method
  check that badge_bounds is set by shape (I think it is)

text_bounds is controlled by entity_shape

background_class : string (default: layer_background_class)
badge : string option
entity_shape : (child -> element_name_type -> bounds -> Svg.elt wrap)
effective_entity : (child -> element_name_type)

get effective entity

that's used to match the rest:
