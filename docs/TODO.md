# TODO

* [ ] Look into using Celluloid and/or jruby to improve performance
* [ ] Conflicts can happen on the same diff 2x. How to handle this?
* [ ] In `Change.to_s` - deref args that point to other elements (like archimate_element)
* [ ] In Diagram children diffs - make to_s reference the parent diagram
* [x] Array diffs on non-id'd diffable elements should detect changes rather than delete/insert
* [ ] Add Split file feature (extract say a diagram or set of elements)
* [ ] Merge unrelated files (this is the intent of Merger)
* [ ] Scorecard lint
* [ ] CLI DSL
* [ ] Add a super strict mode to note when reader finds unexpected content
* [ ] Consider breaking this into a number of gems (for example: base lib, diff/merge, other cmdline tools)
* [ ] Archi file could have ids that conflict (i.e. 2 relationships with same id - this is bad!!! Was it a bad merge or something worse)
* [ ] Consider making classes for each element and relationship type?
* [ ] Figure out how to make rmagick optional and/or remove rmagick dependency
* [ ] Data model items that reference something else by id should have the actual object available - not just the id
* [ ] Implement check for de-duplicated merges
* Convert support for
  - [ ] Rdf
  - [ ] Gremlin
  - [X] Neo4j CSV
  - [X] Cypher
  - [X] N-Quad
  - [X] GraphML
* [X] Add a summary diff - elements added/changed/deleted, diagrams
* [X] Convert all CLIs to use AIO - merge with OutputIO and MaybeIO (maybe)
* [X] Stats (elements, relationships, diagrams)
* [X] figure out a better parent mechanism - it's really not fully cooked
* [X] remove parent_id from dry::struct objects - then can use class schema instead of comparison attributes
* [x] Not handling sketch diagram model in archi
* [X] Use one color method - currently using HighLine and Colorize
* [x] Refactor merge to pull conflict detection out
* [X] Clean up the way that the describe is done on data model
* [X] Permit model items to link back to their parent
* [X] Should be a master hash index of id to object in Model
* [X] Improve description of diffs for conflict display
* [X] Eliminate use of Document in favor of Model
  - [X] cli/archi.rb
  - [X] cli/cleanup.rb
  - [X] cli/convert.rb
  - [X] cli/svger.rb
* [X] Clean up TODOs
* [x] Experiment with Ox, Oga, Sax-Machine for better performance on convert
* [x] Map conversion between archi and archimate diagram formats
* [X] Write a common clone for dry-struct classes
* [X] Make a format agnostic file reader (which delegates to appropriate file type readers)
* [X] Decide between ox and nokogiri and eliminate the alternate
* [X] See what can be done about performance
  - Reading file 11-12 secs
  - deleted relationships referenced in diagrams is slow
* [X] Refactor to better OO design where necessary (see all about names below)
* [X] Refactor merge to pull apply diffs out

## Other tool ideas

* Tool to query for dependencies
* Tool to assign/validate/enforce metadata

## My Classes

* Conflict
* Conflicts
  - `#resolve : Review -> (PatchSet, Conflicts)`
* Difference
* Document
  - `#merge : ~local:Document -> ~remote:Document -> (Document, Conflicts)`
  - `#patch : PatchSet -> Document`
* PatchSet
* Review
  - `#resolve : Conflict -> Difference`

# attributes that are references to other nodes in the model

For any of these inserted or changed...

* Property.key (only after PropertyDefs is introduced)
  - Property referenced deleted key
* Child.target_connections -> Array of SourceConnection ids
  - SourceConnection.id deleted
* Child.archimate_element -> Element.id
  - Element.id deleted
* Folder.items -> Array of IdentifiedNode
  - *.id deleted
* Relationship.source -> Element.id
  - Element.id deleted
* Relationship.target -> Element.id
  - Element.id deleted
* SourceConnection.source -> Child.id
  - Child.id deleted
* SourceConnection.target -> Child.id
  - Child.id deleted
* SourceConnection.relationship -> Relationship.id
  - Relationship.id deleted

Presents a conflict

# Conflicts

1. path is same
2. a.delete IdentifiedNode & b.adds/changes reference to IdentifieNode (as shown above)
3. a.deletes a node and b.insert/change a node under that node's path

Thinking about concurrency for performance improvements

read base
read local
read remote

base + local -> diff l
base + remote -> diff b

diff l + diff b -> conflict detection

cd -> each conflict type

conflicts -> conflict resolution

cr (user response)

serialize result (single)
