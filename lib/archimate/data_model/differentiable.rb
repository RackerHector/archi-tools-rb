    # Let's talk about diff...
    #
    # Here are my expectations of diff:
    #
    # = Preconditions:
    #
    # 1. self is non-nil
    # 2. self is a class that includes Comparison
    #
    # = Requirements for other
    #
    # Not matching one of these is a programming error.
    #
    # 1. Other is nil
    # 2. Other is an instance of the same class as self
    #
    # = Diff results
    #
    # * Diffing results in a list of Diff instances between +self+ and +other+
    # * Patching the list of diffs against self results in an instance that == +other+
    #
    # = Diff Container
    #
    # A diff container is a top level entity that is meaningful in the user domain
    # for example: [Element], [Relationship], [Diagram]. It collects and groups
    # the smaller diffs into the things that changed by an entity tha makes sense
    # to the user.
    #
    # = Diff structure
    #
    # A diff contains a change to be applied in a particular context.
    #
    # Use cases:
    #
    # 1. Delete a value that is a member of this class. Example: Delete the
    #    +a+ member of a [Color] instance.
    # 2. A non-reference value replacing a value in a class. Example:
    #    Changing the +r+ value of a [Color] with a different value.
    # 3. Updating the value of an attribute of a child. (or child's child)
    # 4. Deleting the value of an attribute of a child. (or child's child)
    # 5. For Array attributes with non-referenceable contents
    #    1. Deleting a value from an array attribute
    #    2. Inserting a value into an array attribute
    #    3. Changing a value in an array attribute
    # 6. For Array attributes with referenceable contents
    #    1. Deleting a value from an array attribute (has an implication on
    #       if the entity is deleted from the model entirely)
    #    2. Inserting a value into an array attribute (may need addtion to the
    #       model)
    #    3. Changing a value in an array attribute (changing the entity id may
    #       require the implications of deletion and insertion as above)
    #
    # When to stop?
    #
    # When digging down into a diff operation, there are some natural stopping
    # points:
    #
    # 1. When there is no more depth to dig
    # 2. When the objects being compared are references to other entities, but
    #    do not belong to the current object being diffed.
    # 3. When the object being diffed is a Diff container unto itself. For
    #    example: When diffing a model, the diff should include the order
    #    of elements referenced in the +elements+ attribute, but shouldn't
    #    continue with the diff of each element itself.
    #
    # = Complications
    #
    # == Object references
    #
    # Since a patch operation produces an new replacement object, object
    # references need to be handled. For example, given an +Element+ with +id=3+
    # if a patch changes this +Element+'s name, then the +Element+ in
    # the model under +Model#elements+ is replaced with a different instance,
    # but a +Relationship+ that references the +Element+ is still pointing at
    # a different instance and needs to be updated.
