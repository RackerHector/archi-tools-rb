      # A context sensive 3-way merge is what I want for this customized so that it
      # intelligently works for archi files.

      # Caveat - I don't like folders under model layers - so I'll not bother trying to make those work

      # Should translate to work with meff files with minor changes

      # Should also facilitate a merge of two models with no common base - though more work

      # The entities that I care about are:
      # * Model (really only care about name, purpose/documentation, properties)
      # * Model Entities
      # * Connectors (Junction variations) - same as model entities AFAIK
      # * Relations
      # * Diagrams
      # * Organization (Folders)

      # New node (id not in original doc)
      # Node renamed (id matches, type is same, name changes) -> rename (see warn level based on use of node)
      # Node id conflict (id matches, type is diff) -> re-id node and otherwise treat as add (see id re-mapping section)
      # Node content differs
      #   - @name
      #   - documentation
      #   - property
