      # This sort of conflict occurs when one change set has deleted an element
      # that is referenced by id in the other change set.
      #
      # For example:
      #
      # In the local change set, an element with id "abc123" is deleted.
      # In the remote change set, a child is inserted into a diagram with
      # element = {id: "abc123"...}. These two changes are in conflict.
