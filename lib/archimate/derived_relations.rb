  # 5.6.1 Derivation Rule for Structural and Dependency Relationships
  #
  # The structural and dependency relationships can be ordered by 'strength'.
  # Structural relationships are 'stronger' than dependency relationships, and
  # the relationships within these categories can also be ordered by strength:
  #
  # *  Influence (weakest)
  # *  Access
  # *  Serving
  # *  Realization
  # *  Assignment
  # *  Aggregation
  # *  Composition (strongest)
  #
  # Part of the language definition is an abstraction rule that states that two
  # relationships that join at an intermediate element can be combined and
  # replaced by the weaker of the two.
  #
  #   5.6.2 Derivation Rules for Dynamic Relationships
  #
  # For the two dynamic relationships, the following rules apply:
  #
  # *  If there is a flow relationship r from element a to element b, and a
  #    structural relationship from element c to element a, a flow relationship
  #    r can be derived from element c to element b.
  # *  If there is a flow relationship r from element a to element b, and a
  #    structural relationship from element d to element b, a flow relationship
  #    r can be derived from element a to element d.
  #
  # These rules can be applied repeatedly. Informally, this means that the
  # begin and/or endpoint of a flow relationship can be transferred 'backward'
  # in a chain of elements connected by structural relationships. Example 16
  # shows two of the possible flow relationships that can be derived with these
  # rules, given a flow relationship between the two services.
  #
  # This rule also applies for a triggering relationship, but only in
  # combination with an assignment relationship (not with other structural
  # relationships):
  #
  # *  If there is a triggering relationship r from element a to element b, and
  #    an assignment relationship from element c to element a, a triggering
  #    relationship r can be derived from element c to element b.
  # *  If there is a triggering relationship r from element a to element b, and
  #    an assignment relationship from element d to element b, a triggering
  #    relationship r can be derived from element a to element d.
  #
  # Moreover, triggering relationships are transitive:
  #
  # *  If there is a triggering relationship from element a to element b, and a
  #    triggering relationship from element b to element c, a triggering
  #    relationship can be derived from element a to element c.
